My research interest is on validated computation using set-membership framework (interval analysis, affine arithmetic).
I applied this framework in several domains such as temporal systems (discrete or continuous time) in the context of validated numerical integration of dynamical system and integration of it in numerical constraint programming.
I work also on the computation of inner-approximation of such systems.
